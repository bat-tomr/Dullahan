# Dullahan
Create a headless X11 setup in the cloud and on your workstation 

## What for ?
Getting X11 up and running on a headless linux machine can sometimes by pretty tricky and time consuming, especially if the machine is not accessible or impossible to connect a display even temporarily. One particlar case are linux instances on public cloud providers like Amazon or Softlayer. Those instances come with a baremetal linux installation without X11 support and the internet is full of desperate souls looking for solutions to install X11 on their VMs. 
Dullahan is here to help! It is a simple installer that makes the task of installing X11 for headless servers really easy.

## Status
At the moment Dullahan only exists for Debian and only has been thoroughly tested on Ubuntu but RPM based distributions are to come soon. It has been tested on Amazon Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS and on SoftLayer Ubuntu 14.04 instances as well as on standalone workstations.
